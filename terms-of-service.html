							</div>
							<h4 class="color-heading text-adaptive mb-15">
								5. Fees and Payment for Purchased Services
							</h4>
							<div class="color-heading text-adaptive mb-15">
								5.1 Fees. For any paid Subscription, Implementation Service, or other Service You purchase from Us, You will pay all fees specified in the applicable Order Form(s). Except as otherwise specified herein or in an Order Form, (a) fees for the Service are based on the Subscription purchased and the total number of permitted Users or permitted Sites rather than actual usage by Users or Sites and (b) payment obligations are non-cancelable and fees paid are non-refundable.
							</div>
							<div class="color-heading text-adaptive mb-15">
								5.2 Invoicing and Payment. You will provide Us with valid and updated credit card information, or with a valid purchase order or alternative document reasonably acceptable to Us.

Charges will be made in advance, in accordance with the billing frequency stated in the applicable Order Form. If the Order Form specifies that payment will be by a method other than a credit card, We will invoice You in advance and otherwise in accordance with the relevant Order Form. Unless otherwise stated in the Order Form, invoiced charges are due net 30 days from the invoice date. You are responsible for providing complete and accurate billing and contact information to Us and notifying Us of any changes to such information.
							</div>
							<div class="color-heading text-adaptive mb-15">
								5.3 Overdue Charges. If any undisputed invoiced amount is not received by Us by the due date, then without limiting Our rights or remedies, (a) We may charge interest at the rate of 1.5% of the outstanding balance per month, or the maximum rate permitted by law, whichever is lower, (b) We may condition future subscription renewals and Order Forms on payment terms shorter than those specified in Section 5.2 (Invoicing and Payment), and (c) We may require You to pay any collections or legal fees or costs incurred by Us in order to collect payment of the corresponding undisputed invoiced amount.
							</div>
							<div class="color-heading text-adaptive mb-15">
								5.4 Payment Disputes. If You dispute any invoiced amounts, You will promptly provide Us with notice of the disputed amounts along with supporting documentation within 30 days of Your receipt of the invoice, and the parties will cooperate diligently to resolve such dispute in good faith. We will not exercise Our rights under Section 5.3 (Overdue Charges) or 5.4 (Suspension of Service and Acceleration) above if You are disputing the applicable charges reasonably and in good faith and are cooperating diligently to resolve the dispute, provided that You remit payment for any undisputed amounts in a timely manner.
							</div>
							<div class="color-heading text-adaptive mb-15">
								5.5 Taxes. Our fees do not include any taxes, levies, duties, or similar governmental assessments of any nature, including, for example, value-added, sales, use, or withholding taxes, assessable by any jurisdiction whatsoever (collectively, “Taxes”). You are responsible for paying all Taxes associated with Your purchases hereunder. If We have the legal obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which You are responsible under this Section 5.5, We will invoice You and You will pay that amount unless You provide Us with a valid tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority. For clarity, We are solely responsible for taxes assessable against Us based on Our income, property, and employees.
							</div>
							<div class="color-heading text-adaptive mb-15">
								5.6 Future Functionality. You agree that Your purchases are not contingent on the delivery of any future functionality or features, or dependent on any oral or written public comments made by Us regarding future functionality or features.

								12.3 Informal Dispute Resolution and Arbitration. The parties acknowledge that most disputes can be resolved without resort to litigation.

If, after good faith negotiations the parties are unable to resolve the dispute, any and all disputes arising out of or in any way relating to this Agreement, including without limitation its existence, validity, or termination, shall be resolved according to California law and exclusively by binding arbitration before a single arbitrator with the Judicial Arbitration and Mediation Service (“JAMS”) and pursuant to the then existing arbitration rules at JAMS.

								The parties further agree that the arbitration shall be conducted in their individual capacities only and not as a class action or other representative action, and the parties expressly waive their right to file a class action or seek relief on a class basis. If any court or arbitrator determines that the class action waiver set forth herein is void or unenforceable for any reason or that an arbitration can proceed on a class basis, then the portions of this Section 12.3 mandating arbitration shall be deemed null and void in its entirety and the parties shall be deemed to have not agreed to arbitrate disputes.

								12.4 Equitable Relief. Each party acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach by such Party of any of its obligations under Section 7 (Confidentiality) or, in the case of Customer, Section 3.5 (Usage Restrictions), would cause the other Party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees that, in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the other Party will be entitled to equitable relief, including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance, and any other relief that may be available from any court, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy.
